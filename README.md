# govt-data-lab-qualitative
First I had to import the neccessary libraries. Then I had to put the necessary file into jupyter notebooks. Then the code read and printed the information from the entire data file. Then I printed only the first five rows of the data set, to get a feel for how everything looked, and to make sure it looked right. Then I printed a list of the names of the columns of the datafile, the number of columns, and the number of rows of the datafile. Then, the next block of code allows you to select a certain column and rename it something understandable based on the datafiles codebook. The next block allows you to rename the rows based off the codebook as what they represent. The next block of code creates a bar graph to vidualise the data, with the correct row and column names.
